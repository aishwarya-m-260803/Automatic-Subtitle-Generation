Anthology of Modern Indian Poetry by Gwendolyn Goodwin

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,240
I shall not try to flee the sword of death

7
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,919
nor fearing it a watchful vigil keep.

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,119
It will be nothing but a sigh, a breath, a turning on the other side to sleep.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,839
Through all the clothes and tanglements of earth,

10
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:47,200
my spirit shaking off its bonds shall fare and pass,

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,119
and rise in new unfettered birth, escaping from this labyrinth of care.

12
00:00:53,839 --> 00:01:00,559
Within the mortar caravan said I, no rest and no abiding place I know,

13
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,759
I linger here for but a fleeting day and at the morrow's summoning I go.

14
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:17,519
What are these bonds that try to shackle me through all their intricate chains my way I find?

15
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,560
I travel like a wandering melody that floats untamed and taken on the wind.

16
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,759
From an unsympathetic world I flee to you your love and fellowship I crave.

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,560
Oh, singers dead, sawdha and mushafi, I lay my song

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,200
distribute on your grave. End of poem by Amir
