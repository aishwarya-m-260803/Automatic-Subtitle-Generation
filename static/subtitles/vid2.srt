1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
Can I ask you a question?

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,400
Of course you can.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Okay, can you get me out of this place?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm afraid I'm of no use to you there.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Why couldn't they put me in a proper prison?

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,000
A better facility wasn't available.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A point made a muddlch.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,599
It's a secure training centre.

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,600
Training?

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,600
What are the trainings for?

12
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
The other boys are screaming all the time.

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
And they've brought the problems forwards

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,600
and they shall work on it.

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
The other students all away from Corrid.

16
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,600
Why don't you go not every time you see my son-in-law school?

17
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
The second one is done.

18
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,000
What's the best place for you to be?

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ryan gets to stay at home until he's trialled.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ryan is in the queues of such a series.

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Apploved.

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,600
It's all accused.

23
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,000
If I did it, if I hurt her, then I get it.

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,400
But I didn't stand it, Jamie.

25
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
And this wasn't my decision.

26
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm going to get it in the queue.

27
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm going to get it in the queue.

28
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm going to get it in the queue.

29
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Nothing has been decided yet.

30
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
You know where it's going to be?

31
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
You're long in or so, my lord.

32
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,400
You need to sit down, Jamie.

33
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
If you don't sit down.

34
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Does that mean you don't know?

35
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Does that mean you don't know what you just want to tell me?

36
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,799
I think it's been decided yet.

37
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,000
You need to sit down.

38
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't want to sit down.

39
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you don't sit down, I have to stop this discussion.

40
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Maybe I want you to.

41
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you?

42
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It appears rough that wouldn't it?

43
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You got to go home and then come back again.

44
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,599
Jamie, if you do not sit down.

45
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,599
Look, fucking want to sit down.

46
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,200
You, not.

47
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,199
Tell me where to sit down.

48
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,599
You do not control why, fuck.

49
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,000
Look at me now.

50
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You do not control why I do in my life.

51
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,400
Get that in that fucking little idiot.

52
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Fuck you now.
