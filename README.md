# Automatic Subtitle Generation 🎬📝

This project focuses on automatically generating subtitles for audio/video content using Machine Learning and speech processing techniques. It was developed as part of my learning journey in Python, Machine Learning, and web application development.

## Project Overview

Automatic Subtitle Generation is a web-based application that takes audio input and generates subtitle files (`.srt`) automatically. The project demonstrates how speech-to-text concepts can be integrated with a web interface to build a practical and real-world application.

The application includes a user-friendly interface where users can upload audio files and view the generated subtitles.
